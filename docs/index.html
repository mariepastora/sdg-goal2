The goals set a roadmap that all UN members have to achieve by 2030. </p> <p>Each goal has a number of targets and indicators, used to monitor progress towards the goal. In some cases data is abundant, but in others, it is scarcely measured.</p> <p>If all goals are crucial to the well-being of humanity, goal number 2 targets food security and focuses on ending hunger, worldwide, which is a necessary step to improve the quality of life. This goal is goal number 2, and it counts five different targets.</p> <p>Results are encouraging. An indicator evolving particularly positively is one measuring the proportion of children under five years old whose growth has been stunted due to malnourishment. The world average was about 32.6 per cent in 2000, and, as of 2015, was of 24 per cent, which represents a change of 8.6 percentage point.</p> <h5>Prevalence of stunting among children under five years of age, by World Bank region</h5> <p>Hover over each line to see which region it represents.</p> <div id="line-chart-growth"></div> <hr> <p class="note">Source: Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates (2018 Edition), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Bank Group.</p> <p>If results are encouraging, the world is still far from achieving the goals set for 2030 in certain areas. When it comes to undernourishment, 10.7 per cent of the world population was undernourished in 2015. This number is better than the 14.8 per cent of 2000, but still far from the 0 per cent target set for 2030.</p> <h5>Undernourishment worldwide: a 2015 snapshot</h5> <p>The black square represents the
